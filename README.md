# My LLMs, NLPs and Generative AI Projects

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains my projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI.

## 🧠 What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

LLMs are advanced models based on supervised learning, pretrained on vast amounts of data. They excel in understanding and generating natural language, performing a wide range of tasks. [Learn more about LLMs](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models).


## 🔍 What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable way. NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## 🎨 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content, such as text, images, or music, based on the patterns they have learned from existing data. These models can create realistic and creative outputs, pushing the boundaries of what machines can do in terms of creativity and innovation. Examples include text generation, image synthesis, and more. [Learn more about Generative AI](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/generative-ai?hl=en)
